# Personal portfolio website

## About

This project is a simple portfolio website about myself. It includes
some information about myself, my main technical skills, some of the projects I have built
as well some of my contact information along with the links to my various portfolio items.

## How it was built

This project was built using React.js and React Router which
was used for the client side routing.

## How to execute

To execute this project is fairly simple. The first thing to do would be
to ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. Once that is done, you
can either clone the git repository or copy the files from GitHub. Next you should
navigate into the proejcts directory and run the command 'npm start'. This should automatically
open up the home page in your web browser. If not you can manually type in the URL http://localhost:3000
into your browser. 

I will attach a link to the deployed version of this project below.

## How to use

Once the project is executed, you the first page that will appear is the home page.
To switch between the different pages simply click on one of the navbar items in the 
top right hand corner of the page to display the different components.
